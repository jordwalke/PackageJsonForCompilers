#PackageJsonForCompilers

Sandboxing Native Compilation And Then Some

> Note: This has little to nothing to do with node - just by convention, we assume
that sources for dependencies are placed into `node_modules`, but we could have
just as easily named that directory anything else.

This document describes a proposal for laying out directories for sources, artifacts, as well as some utilities that we plan to provide to compilers/build systems in order for them to work seamlessly within this directory convention. It should ideally create some shared conventions that `ocamlopt`/`ocamlc`/`BuckleScript`/`opam`, and possibly even `clang` packages can abide by in order to seamlessly depend on each other - even in the face of multiple versions, or multiple targetted architectures. Build systems do not have to generate or even be aware of this directory structure, they merely need to use a couple of utilities in order required to work well within it.

General features required:
- Allows multiple versions of packages to coexist (it's important).
- Builds out of source, installs out of source.
  - That enables symlinking of packages (important).
- Plays nice with `ocamlfind`.
- Allows cleaning up of build artifacts trivially, merely by deleting a single `_build` directory.
- Supports `opam` variables and attempts to make it feasible to build an adapter that allows seamless OPAM interop.

Desirable Outcome:
One click depending on `opam` files withing a cross compiled environment - all build systems should do the right thing, and put artifacts in the right place inside of the sandbox, with a single `yarn install` or `npm install`.

In general, we have a top level package, with dependencies inside of `node_modules`, and two directories `_build` and `_install` which each mirror the entire sandbox.

Expanding out a bit, we see that inside of the `_install`, each package resides
in its mirrored location. Each package has its *own* `findlib` root, with its
own `bin`/`lib` etc. This is very important as it allows multiple versions of a
single package to exist simultaneously.

## This Is Intended For *Any* Build System.

Most of this is not specific to any particular build system, and build systems don't need to know about this *exact* directory structure. When a package is built (via its `postinstall`), `dependencyEnv` sets up environment variables that handles all the logic of figuring out where things should go.

## This Is Intended For *Any* Language.
The `findlib` portions of this are optional. Your package builds don't have to use them - but you may be able to adapt `findlib` to your langauge as well. Take it or leave it - it's not critical to `PackageJsonForCompilers`.

## Doing It Right

To properly create a package:

1. Activate the build utilities via `dependency-env`:
  - Add [dependency-env](https://github.com/reasonml/dependency-env) to your package's `dependencies`.
  - In your `postinstall`, prefix your build command with `eval $(dependencyEnv)
    &&`, in order activate the utilities to help you perform a proper build. For example: `eval $(dependencyEnv) && make`.

2. Enjoy some benefits of `dependencyEnv`.
`dependencyEnv` sets the `OCAMLFIND_CONF` environment variable to point to an *automatically* generated `findlib.conf`. This makes it so popular build tooling (`ocamlbuild/rebuild`, `ocamlfind`) can "see" your built `npm` dependencies. `dependencyEnv` also sets up a bunch of other helpful environment variables that your build scripts can use.

3. Respect the `cur__target_dir` environment variable in your build scripts.
Your build system should try to only generate artifacts inside of `cur__target_dir`. This makes sure your package build works with symlinks, and multiple simultaneous versions of your package.

4. Respect the `cur__install` environment variable in your build scripts:
So far your package build plays nice, and can build correctly because it can "see" its dependencies at build time via `findlib.conf`. That's good but it doesn't mean *your* package's artifacts will be visible to *other* packages that depend on *you*! To make your package available and visible to your dependers, your build system should generate a `META` file, and *install* it (along with a subset of the artifacts) into `cur__install` (`ocamlfind install -destdir $cur__install $cur__name META`).

|Environment Variable| Meaning                                                            | Equivalent To                        |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| `cur__name`  | Normalized name of package name (converts hyphens to underscores)        |                                      |
| `cur__target_dir`  | Where build artifacts should go for the currently building package  | Cargo's `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` (loosely) |
| `cur__install`     | Install root for currently building package. Contains lib/bin/etc   | OPAM's `prefix` var, but is a dedicated install directory just for this package |


## Environment Variables

When `your-package` is being built, `cur__target_dir` and `cur__install` are
set to the artifact and install destinations for `your-package`. This helps
avoid cluttering up your source files with artifacts, and keeps it symlink
friendly / caching friendly.

###### Opam Variables That Don't Make Sense To Recreate

#### Variables Automatically Published by *Your* Dependencies

Sometimes, your dependencies want to communicate values/paths to you. They can do this easily in their `package.json`'s `exportedEnvVars` field, which causes those values to be visible to your build scripts (as long as you do `eval $(dependencyEnv)`).

Some environment variables are *automatically* published without them even having to specify them. If `my-package` has a *direct* dependency on `my-dependency`, then whenever `my-package` invokes `eval $(dependencyEnv)`, it will see the following environment variables changed:


|Environment Variable     | Your Package's Dependers See This Value As     | Equivalent To                           | Implemented |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-------------|
|`PATH`                   | Augmented with `my_dependency__bin`            |                                         | No          |
|`MAN_PATH`               | Augumented with `my_dependency__man`           | OPAM's `PKG:name` but not transitive    | No          |
|`my_dependency__name`    | Normalized name of the `my-dependency` (`my_dependency`) | OPAM's `PKG:name` but not transitive    | No          |
|`my_dependency__version` | Version of the `my-dependency`                 | OPAM's `PKG:version` but not transitive | No          |
|`my_dependency__depends` | Resolved direct dependencies of `my-dependency`| OPAM's `PKG:depends`                    |             |
|`my_dependency__bin`     | Binary install directory for `my-dependency`   | OPAM's `PKG:bin` but not transitive     | No          |
|`my_dependency__sbin`    | System install Binary directory for `my-dependency`| OPAM's `PKG:sbin` but not transitive| No          |
|`my_dependency__lib`     | Library install directory for `my-dependency`  | OPAM's `PKG:lib` but not transitive     | No          |
|`my_dependency__man`     | Man install directory for `my-dependency`      | OPAM's `PKG:man` but not transitive     | No          |
|`my_dependency__doc`     | Docs install directory for `my-dependency`     | OPAM's `PKG:doc` but not transitive     | No          |
|`my_dependency__share`   | Share install directory for `my-dependency`    | OPAM's `PKG:share` but not transitive   | No          |
|`my_dependency__etc`     | Etc install directory for `my-dependency`      | OPAM's `PKG:etc` but not transitive     | No          |


Many of these variables have OPAM equivalents, with the exception that they are only published by *immediate* dependencies. The reason is that unlike OPAM, we support multiple versions per package in the transitive dependency graph - so some of these variables would no longer be well-defined if we allowed them to be published by transitive dependencies.

The following OPAM variables will be more difficult to implement as environment variables, but we should support them anyways.

|OPAM var        |                                                 | Difficult Because                                                                 | Implemented |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|
|`PKG:installed` | Whether the package is installed                | Need to scan "optionalDeps" and set false if missing                              | No          |
|`PKG:enable`    | "enable" or "disable" depending on if installed | "                                                                                 | No          |
|`PKG:build`     | Where `my-dependency` ended up being built      | We *tell* packages where to build. They might not respect that - how do we know?  | No          |


Others not yet implemented: (`PKG:hash`, `user`, `group`, `make`, `os`,
`ocaml-version`, `opam-version` `compiler`, `preinstalled`, `switch`, `jobs`,
`ocaml-native`, `ocaml-native-tool`, `ocaml-native-dynli`, `arch` )




## `buildTimeOnlyDependencies`

> Note: These have nothing to do with `devDependencies`.

Suppose `MyPackage` depends on `make-v1.2.2` and `MyDependency` depends on
`make-v1.1.1`. Imagine how unnecessarily difficult it would be if our package
manager refused to let us install/build both of these versions of `make`. The
two versions of `make` really have nothing to do with each other and should
never see each other. They were merely tools that we needed in order to build
each package.

This is very different than our app pulling in two versions of the standard
library at *runtime*. That would legitimately cause conflicts and it's
reasonable for the package manager/build system to tell us to fix the conflict.

`PackageJsonForCompilers` will support a `package.json` config property called
[`buildTimeOnlyDependencies`](https://github.com/facebook/reason/issues/816#issue-183870566).

While they don't yet make use of it, package managers should take
`buildTimeOnlyDependencies` into account when resolving package versions and
deciding how to best flatten - it's a good opportunity for package managers to
relax their task of resolving to one version per package. But even if package
managers don't take this into account, we can still build as if they did, and
create tooling for for generating shrinkwrap/lock files as if they *did*.  Or,
if you just let `npm`/`yarn` do their thing and install multiple versions,
`PackageJsonForCompilers` will work well at compile time, and likely even link
time because:

1. `PackageJsonForCompilers` will support building multiple versions per
package. As usual, `node_modules` ensures that there is (literally) space for
multiple versions of source code for them. The exact shape of the `_build` and
`_install` directories ensures that there is (literally) space for multiple
versions to be built.

2. `PackageJsonForCompilers` will ensure that if there are multiple versions of
your dependency at build time, your package will see the *right* version.  All
of the environment variables will be set accordingly, and `findlib` will be
configured such that you compile against the *right* version. Multiple versions
might exist, but you won't see the *wrong* ones.

It's normal for `buildTimeOnlyDependencies` to result in multiple versions of
packages that are each compiled into their own quarantined `_build` and
`_install`. It's *not* normal for multiple *versions* of runtime dependencies
though.

Before package managers support the `buildTimeOnlyDependencies` well, you might
get in a scenario where you get a link time failure - it won't be due to any
`buildTimeOnlyDependencies` that you depend on - that link time failure will be
a genuine package conflict you need to fix. If package managers supported
`buildTimeOnlyDependencies` well, you would have still had an error - but it
would have been the package manager letting you know early that there *will* be
a link time failure. Without help from package managers, you'll just hear about
it much later, and with a more cryptic error.

## Cross Compiling


Cross compiling *sounds* similar but is very different, and only a little bit
related to `buildTimeOnlyDependencies`. Cross compiling happens when for
*whatever* reason, a package needs to be compiled to an architecture that is
different than the host architecture. Mobile toolchain compilers are the most
mainstream use case you'll likely encounter.

When installing/building a dependency graph, `PackageJsonForCompilers` pays
attention to your `TARGET_ARCHITECTURE` environment variable (which you can
export in your `package.json`'s `exportedEnvVars` field). By default
`TARGET_ARCHITECTURE` is assumed to be equal to your host architecture if
unspecified.

That, among other things, influences whether or not a package is cross
compiled.

`PackageJsonForCompilers` makes "space" to build cross compiled packages
without stepping on your regular artifacts, by suffixing `_install` and
`_build` with the architecture. By default, it's assumed `_install`/`_build`
refer to the host architecture. Here's what that would look like for
`TARGET_ARCHITECTURE=arm64`.

It is not immediately obvious how many architectures a package at a specific version
needs to be compiled for.
We get into some interesting scenarios when looking at how package manager
resolution combines with `buildTimeOnlyDependencies`, `TARGET_ARCHITECTURE`.

Consider the following scenario. The package manager (or `shrinkwrap` etc) has
resolved `PackageC` to a single version, though multiple packages depend on it.
There is one location for `PackageC`'s source code (likely in
`node_modules/C`). If nothing is marked as a `buildTimeOnlyDependencies`, then
everything is simple.


If `TARGET_ARCHITECTURE` is empty, (defaulted to host), then no matter what,
`PackageJsonForCompilers` will build everything according to the simplest
convention.

Similarly, any of the arrows in the above dependency diagram could be listed in
the parent package's `buildTimeOnlyDependencies`, and nothing would change
because no matter what, everything needs to run on the host architecture (build
time or not!) and since there's only one `PackageC` source, we only need to
build it at most once.

If `TARGET_ARCHITECTURE` is `arm64` (different than host), and *nothing* is
marked in `buildTimeOnlyDependencies`, then everything must be clearly be
compiled for `arm64`, and no dependencies need to execute on the host for
building.

Now, consider if `TARGET_ARCHITECTURE` is `arm64` (different than host), and
*only the dependency from `PackageA` to `PackageC`* is marked in
`buildTimeOnlyDependencies`. There's still *one* version of `PackageC`
resolved, but it changes the number of times `PackageJsonForCompilers` will
compile it.  `PackageA` needs to run `PackageC` at build time (so on the host
architecture) and `PackageB` needs to run `PackageC` at runtime. Since the
runtime architecture is different than the build time architecture,
`PackageJsonForCompilers` will ensure that at package install time, `PackageC`
is compiled twice into appropriately suffixed `_build`/`_install` directories,
even though there's only one *version* of `PackageC`'s source resolved on disk.

So `PackageJsonForCompilers`'s directory layout is flexible enough to support
compiling of multiple versions of a *single* package, in their isolated
quarantined areas, but this last example shows that it's also flexible enough
to support a *single* version of a package compiled *multiple times* in the
case of a different `TARGET_ARCHITECTURE`.


Quickly consider if `PackageB` where listed in `buildTimeOnlyDependencies` of
`PackageA`, while `TARGET_ARCHITECTURE` was `arm64` as before.

      │PackageA │

      └──────────────┘

- `PackageA` must be compiled for the `TARGET_ARCHITECTURE`.
- `PackageC` must be compiled for the `TARGET_ARCHITECTURE` because it's needed by `PackageA` at runtime.
- `PackageB` must be compiled for the host.
- `PackageC` must be compiled for the host as well! Even though `PackageC` is a
  *runtime* dependency of `PackageB`! When `PackageB` acts as a
  `buildTimeOnlyDependency`, `PackageB`'s "runtime", is not the
  `TARGET_ARCHITECTURE` - it is the *host* architecture.


`PackageJsonForCompilers` handles all of these cases and provides physical
space for all of these artifacts to exist in harmony, simultaneously.

### Not Shown In This Spec

- Opinionated build system conventions such as module aliases/namespaces.
- How we would implement the system that walks the dependency graph, asking
  each package to build itself into the correct locations.
- How we know which architecture to specify when building a package (based on
  `buildTimeOnlyDependency`, the host architecture, and "target" architecture).
- How we know how many times to build a package - how many architectures.
